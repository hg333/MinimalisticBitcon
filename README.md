# MinimalisticBitcon
Minimalistic Bitcoin is a very small implementation of Bitcoin. 

I wrote it to have a better understanding of the Bitcoin protocol at low-level

## Quick Start
* Clone the repository. ```git clone https://github.com/hg333/MinimalisticBitcon.git```
* Execute connection.py file ```python3 connection.py```

That's it, you have a very tiny, very limited bitcoin-node working at port 8333 of your machine.

The network between two nodes is estavlished via handshake demonstrated above.
